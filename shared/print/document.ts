/**
 * Renderer-independent PrintDocument v1 (#442, epic #438).
 *
 * A PrintDocument is the authoritative SEMANTIC representation of a printed
 * receipt: an ordered list of blocks (business header, document meta,
 * customer, item table, tax breakdown, totals, payments, messages). It is
 * produced by pure builders from caller-supplied normalized snapshots and
 * consumed by renderers that choose physical layout (ESC/POS token lines,
 * HTML, …). No transport APIs and no byte tokens (`{CENTER}` etc.) exist in
 * this model.
 *
 * PURITY RULES (same contract as the rest of `shared/print/`, see README.md):
 *   - Types + pure functions only. No Electron, DOM, Node built-ins, DB,
 *     filesystem, network, or transport IO of any kind.
 *   - Builders perform NO database IO and NO financial recomputation. Tax
 *     components, totals and payment amounts arrive as printed truth inside
 *     {@link PrintData}; builders only apply presence/show decisions.
 *   - Labels are carried as concept references plus already-resolved strings
 *     (resolved through the injected {@link PrintContext.resolveLabel}
 *     catalog lookup) or explicit bilingual pairs — never pre-concatenated
 *     `"A / B"` strings.
 *   - Every block carries its resolved base direction; embedded values are
 *     annotated via the direction kernel so LTR islands (invoice numbers,
 *     phone numbers, amounts) stay distinguishable inside RTL documents.
 *
 * First consumer: the classic thermal receipt rendered through the backend
 * preview pipeline (#442). Merchant template schemas (#447/#448) and other
 * renderers adopt this model in later issues; schema documentation is owned
 * by #449.
